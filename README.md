# LatentCauseInfer_ModelBased

Code for Model Based Planning with Latent Cause Inference. 

Code for the main model is in the folder "model_main" and is written in MATLAB (w/apologies to all the haters). 
MB_code_main.m is the main script to run.

The results for the simulations presented in the paper are in a csv file (in simulation_results folder).

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
